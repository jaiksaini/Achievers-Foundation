        "A Digital Object Identifier (DOI) Engine is a doi registration agency which provides a serial code that uniquely identifies objects. Particularly for electronic publications like journal articles, the DOI Engine system is employed. In 2020, the DOI Engine system was introduced and this system does not belong to any other doi provider in any form. The DOI Engine name is recorded alongside object-specific metadata. It might also contain the location of the thing, like a URL. As they maintain the journals, published papers, books, and other available educational resources, digital online and virtual libraries are the repository of knowledge.",
